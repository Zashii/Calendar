This app allows users to log in with their own ID and manage their calendar.

Clicking new entry will pop up a modal that allows users to set an appointment on the day and time desired. The application will then display the data in the date selected.

Additionally, when a day on the calendar is selected, that day's agenda pops up to the right of the calendar.
